# ðŸ”§ Issues Fixed - Summary

## Issues Reported and Fixed

### âœ… 1. Logo Not Showing / Too Big
**Problem:** Logo was too big and not displaying on the page
**Root Cause:** Invalid Tailwind class `h-18` (not a standard spacing unit)

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed header height from `lg:h-18` to `lg:h-20` (valid Tailwind class)
- Adjusted logo sizing to be more visible:
  - Mobile: `h-9` (36px)
  - Tablet: `h-10` (40px)
  - Desktop: `h-11` (44px)
- Removed max-width constraints that were limiting logo size
- Removed backdrop-blur effect that may have caused rendering issues
- Changed width/height props to 180x45 for better aspect ratio

**Result:** Logo now displays properly and has appropriate size across all devices

### âœ… 2. Header Links No Hover Effect
**Problem:** Navigation links in the header didn't show hover effects
**Root Cause:** The underline animation span was positioned absolutely but may not have been visible

**Fix Applied:**
- Simplified hover effect to just color change
- Changed from `hover:text-primary-600` with underline animation
- To direct color transition: `text-neutral-700 hover:text-primary-600`
- Removed the absolute positioned span that was causing issues
- Added smooth `transition-colors duration-200`

**Result:** Navigation links now clearly change color on hover

### âœ… 3. Featured Article (Hero Section) No Hover Effect
**Problem:** The featured article card on the left didn't have visible hover effects
**Root Cause:** Border was too thin (1px) making the hover state change barely noticeable

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed border from `border` (1px) to `border-2` (2px)
- Enhanced border color change: `hover:border-primary-500` (more vibrant green)
- Improved shadow effect: `hover:shadow-xl` (more pronounced)
- Kept existing effects:
  - Image zoom on hover
  - Title color change
  - Arrow icon translation
  - Gradient overlay

**Result:** Featured article now has a clear, visible hover effect with border color change and strong shadow

### âœ… 4. Subscribe Button Text Not Readable
**Problem:** Subscribe button hover effect turned text white making it impossible to read
**Root Cause:** Button had white background with white text on hover

**Fix Applied:**
- **Changed default state:** 
  - From: `border-2 border-primary-600 text-primary-600` (outline style)
  - To: `bg-primary-600 text-white` (filled style)
- **Changed hover state:**
  - From: `hover:bg-primary-600 hover:text-white` (both white)
  - To: `hover:bg-primary-700` (darker green, text stays white)
- Added subtle shadow on hover: `hover:shadow-md`

**Result:** Button is now always readable - white text on green background, with darker green on hover

## Notes

All fixes maintain the overall design aesthetic while improving functionality and user experience. The changes are subtle but make a significant difference in usability.

The subscribe button is now in a "filled" style by default, which is actually more common for primary CTAs in modern web design. This ensures it's always prominent and readable.
